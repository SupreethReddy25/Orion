An Occlusion-Robust Vision-Language Retrieval Framework using a Completion-Consistency Loss to fine-tune CLIP



\# ORION: An Occlusion-Robust Invariant Retrieval Framework



\*\*ORION\*\* is a research project focused on enhancing the robustness of vision-language models like CLIP against partial occlusions. The system is fine-tuned using a novel \*\*completion-consistency loss\*\*, forcing the model to generate invariant embeddings for original, occluded, and reconstructed images.

\## The Problem



State-of-the-art vision-language models perform exceptionally well on clean benchmark datasets but fail significantly when faced with real-world scenarios where objects are partially occluded. This project demonstrates a practical method to mitigate this performance degradation.



\## Key Features

\- \*\*Fine-tuned CLIP Model:\*\* Built upon the powerful `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`.

\- \*\*Novel Consistency Loss:\*\* A custom loss function that aligns embeddings of clean and occluded images.

\- \*\*Interactive Demo:\*\* A live demo hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

\- \*\*Reproducible Results:\*\* All code, trained model weights, and evaluation scripts are provided.



\## Baseline Performance

\*This section will be updated after initial experiments.\*

\- \*\*Clean Image Accuracy (Top-1):\*\* TBD

\- \*\*Occluded Image Accuracy (Top-1):\*\* TBD



\## Final Results

\*This section will be updated after fine-tuning.\*

\- \*\*Clean Image Accuracy (Top-1):\*\* TBD

\- \*\*Occluded Image Accuracy (Top-1):\*\* TBD
